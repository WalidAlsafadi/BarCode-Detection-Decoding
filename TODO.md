## Project Tasks

### Core Functionality Review
- [x] Verify all test files under the `tests/` directory.
  - [x] Run the tests and ensure all modules are working as expected.
  - [x] Debug and fix any failing tests.
  - [x] Enhance existing test cases or add new ones if needed.

- [x] Enhance Barcode Preprocessing
  - [x] Explore advanced preprocessing techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholding, image sharpening, edge enhancement).
  - [x] Test preprocessing enhancements with noisy, rotated, and blurred images.
  - [x] Compare results before and after enhancements.

- [x] Enhance Barcode Detection
  - [x] Review and optimize the detection process in `detect_barcode.py`.
  - [ ] Handle edge cases such as partially visible, overlapping, or distorted barcodes.
  - [ ] Improve logging for better debugging and analysis.

- [ ] Enhance Barcode Decoding
  - [ ] Ensure decoding handles multiple barcodes in a single image.
  - [ ] Gracefully handle unreadable barcodes.
  - [ ] Test decoding for different barcode types (e.g., EAN-13, QR codes).

### Final Report
- [x] Prepare a comprehensive project report.
  - **Sections to include:**
    1. **Introduction**: Purpose and objectives of the project.
    2. **Methodology**: Steps for barcode preprocessing, detection, and decoding.
    3. **Results**: Include test results with images before and after detection.
    4. **Challenges**: Highlight limitations and future improvements.
    5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and achievements.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Create a user interface (UI) with Streamlit.
  - [ ] Allow users to upload an image with a barcode.
  - [ ] Display the processed image with detected barcodes and decoded text.
  - [ ] Enable downloading of processed images.
  - [ ] Display decoded barcode types and data in a structured format.

- [ ] Extend Preprocessing
  - [ ] Add support for multi-barcode detection.
  - [ ] Enable batch processing via the UI.

### Documentation
- [x] Update the `README.md` file with:
  - [x] Steps for any new features.
  - [x] Usage instructions.
  - [x] Contribution guidelines.
